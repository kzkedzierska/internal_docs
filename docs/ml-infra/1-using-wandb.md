# Using Weights & Biases  

Weights & Biases (W&B) is a tool that helps you track your machine learning experiments. It allows you to log hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts (like models, datasets, and images) to a dashboard. This makes it easy to compare different experiments and share results with your team.
